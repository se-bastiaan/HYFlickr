# HYFlickr

This is a Wordpress photo album plugin using Flickr's API via [phpFlickr](https://github.com/dan-coulter/phpflickr).
I built this in 1 day for https://nsvvheyendaal.nl/ to provide a simple UI with [fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) to our private albums.
It's far from perfect but I thought sharing it wouldn't hurt.
